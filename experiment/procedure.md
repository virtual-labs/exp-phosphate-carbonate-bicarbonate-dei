Procedure for the experiment is as follows:

Step 1 : Weigh the 1.42gm of Disodium Hydrogen Phosphate (Na2HPO4) and 1.36gm of Potassium Dihydrogen Phosphate (KH2PO4) in a petridish and weighing them seperate by using weighing machine.

Step 2 : Make the solution of Disodium Hydrogen Phosphate (Na2HPO4) by adding small amount of distilled water and stirrer it properly in a beaker and make the volume upto 100ml (0.1M).

Step 3 : Make the solution of Potassium Dihydrogen Phosphate (KH2PO4) by adding small amounts of distilled water and stirrer it properly in a different beaker and make the volume upto 100ml (0.1M).

Step 4 : Preparing a buffer solution for pH range 7.2, 70ml of 0.1M Disodium Hydrogen Phosphate(Na2HPO4) and 30ml of 0.1M Potassium Dihydrogen Phosphate(KH2PO4) were mixed and make volume upto 100ml, and adjust the pH of the solution by adding NaOH or HCl.

Step 5 : Measure the pH of the buffer solution with the help of pH meter by dipping the glass electrode in buffer solution.
