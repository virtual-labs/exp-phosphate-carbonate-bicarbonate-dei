<p>Simulation Procedure for the experiment to determine the required amounts of conjugate acid and base of a given molarity and pH:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>Select the molarity of the buffer and pH you wish to make prepare from the header.</li>
            <li>Enter the values of required variables as according to selected buffer type.</li>
            <li>Submit the values.</li>
            <li>Write rest of the steps as per simulation</li>
          </ol>

<h4>Confirmatory example:</h4>
<p>Procedure to prepare Phosphate Buffer Solution 0.1 M pH 7.2:</p>
<ol>
  <li>1.42gm of Disodium Hydrogen Phosphate (Na<sub>2</sub>HPO<sub>4</sub>) and 1.36gm of Potassium Dihydrogen Phosphate (KH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>) in two separate beakers by using weighing machine.</li>
  <li>Make the solution of Disodium Hydrogen Phosphate (Na<sub>2</sub>HPO<sub>4</sub>) by adding small amount of distilled water and stirrer it properly in a beaker and make the volume upto 100ml (0.1M).</li>
  <li>Make the solution of Potassium Dihydrogen Phosphate (KH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>) by adding small amounts of distilled water and stirrer it properly in a different beaker and make the volume upto 100ml (0.1M).</li>
  <li>Preparing a buffer solution for pH range 7.2, 70ml of 0.1M Disodium Hydrogen Phosphate (Na<sub>2</sub>HPO<sub>4</sub>) and 30ml of 0.1M Potassium Dihydrogen Phosphate (KH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>) were mixed and make volume upto 100ml and adjust the pH of the solution by adding NaOH or HCl.</li>
  <li>Measure the pH of the buffer solution with the help of pH meter by dipping the glass electrode in buffer solution.</li>
</ol>
 
<p>Procedure to prepare Carbonate-Bicarbonate Buffer Solution:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Take 80.0 mL of distilled water in a suitable container.</li>
  <li>Add 0.2934 g of Sodium bicarbonate to the 80 mL distilled water taken to form a solution.</li>
  <li>Add 0.6897 g of Sodium carbonate (anhydrous) to the solution.</li>
  <li>Add distilled water until the volume is 100 mL.</li>
  <li>Adjust the pH of the solution by adding NaOH or HCl.</li>
  <li>Measure the pH of the buffer solution with the help of pH meter by dipping the glass electrode in buffer solution.</li>
